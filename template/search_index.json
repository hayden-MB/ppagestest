[[["index.html"],"BookML template","Skip to content. BookML template BookML template Author You can use this template in the following ways: (1)​Replace the content of template.tex with your content. To change the file names in the output, rename: •​template.tex to NAME.tex, •​template-sans.tex to NAME-sans.tex (and adjust its content), •​template-sans-large.tex to NAME-sans-large.tex (and adjust its content). (2)​Add LaTeX files to the same folder containing template.tex. Any files containing the string \\documentclass (even commented out) will be compiled separately. You may delete template.tex and accompanying sans and sans-large files if you are not using them. In all cases, consult template.tex for how to use more advanced BookML functionality (such as providing large print PDFs or setting additional PDF and SCORM metadata). For use with Overleaf (requires paid account): (1)​Upload the template to a new Overleaf project. Ensure that the .github folder is also included. (2)​From the Overleaf menu, sync the project with a new (private) GitHub repository. After one or two minutes, you will receive an email announcing that the repository has a new a release containing the various BookML outputs. Follow the link in the email to download them. (3)​Every time you sync your Overleaf changes to GitHub, a new build will start and generate a new release. (4)​For a moderate speed up, change the TeX Live scheme in the file .github/workflows/bookml.yaml. This will download smaller TeX Live images containing fewer packages. (5)​If the build is cancelled, increase the timeout in the same file. See the BookML action documentation for more details. Copyright © 2025 Author. Compiled with BookML v0.14.0."]]
